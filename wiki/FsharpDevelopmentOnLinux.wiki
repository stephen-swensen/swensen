#summary tips and tricks for fsharp development on linux with mono
#labels mono,linux

Current instructions for openSUSE 13.1

  * install mono-complete, monodevelop, and fsharp packages from the Tehnari repositories (the offical repos are too out of date)
  * install libgnomeui missing dependency that causes monodevelop crash on startup
  * install F# add-in from the MonoDevelop add-in manager

Problems
  * xbuild fails with claim of missing "Build" target (the main Microsoft target inherited by all projects)
  * MonoDevelop often gives disruptive dialog prompt warnings about multiple F# Interactive bindings
